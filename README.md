👋 Hi, I’m @Amit Lamsal, a passionate coder and IT enthusiast from Nepal, currently running my own tech company, Code Zenith Private Limited.
👀 I’m deeply interested in coding, specializing in network technologies for high-density environments like hospitals, and I’m also keen on web development, with a particular focus on creating intuitive and impactful healthcare solutions.
🌱 I’m currently learning ASP.NET Core, C#, HTML, and CSS as I build out a comprehensive medical website, A5 Lamsal Medical Center, which will include advanced features like a pharmacy section for streamlined patient care. I’m also exploring statistical modeling and probability to enhance data-driven decision-making in my projects.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative tech projects, especially those that integrate healthcare technology and statistical modeling. I’m also open to working with others interested in internships or collaborative remote work in tech.
📫 You can reach me at amitlamsal33@gmail.com, or feel free to connect with me here to discuss potential collaborations, project ideas, or internship opportunities.
